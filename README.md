 Welcome to Aarjav Jain's Code Universe! 



 B.Tech CSE student at Graphic Era University (CGPA: 9.13) crafting innovative solutions with MERN, Solidity, and AI. From building AI-powered finance apps to deploying blockchain tokens, I’m passionate about turning ideas into reality. Let’s explore my journey!

🧑‍💻 About Me
Hey there! I’m Aarjav Jain, a coder, problem-solver, and tech explorer. I thrive on building scalable web apps, diving into blockchain, and tackling DSA challenges. Whether it’s creating a smart finance platform or contributing to open-source, I’m driven by the thrill of innovation. Outside coding, I’m a hackathon enthusiast, a LeetCode grinder, and a coffee aficionado. 

Currently: Building SIMPLFY, an AI-driven finance app.
Exploring: Web3, DevOps, and advanced ML algorithms.
Fun Fact: I once debugged a C++ code while sleep-deprived and still beat my own LeetCode time!
